== A BINARY THEORY OF COLLAPSE. ==

- civilisation al collapse: decline of human populations or production (physical or intellectual).
- two factors
	- anthropological
		- collective
		- individual
	- environmental
		- natural disasters and climate fluctuations

- collective factors
	- sustentative-reproductive: "maintenance and nourishment of human beings."
		- population greater than carrying capacity? 

	- myopic factors
		- issues in the decision making process.
		- Gini ratio: measures wealth inequality. 

- individual
	- caused by 1. Ego or 2. Irrationality.

- our collapse
	- "would require to double our current agricultural output" -> cannot support population -> sus.-reproductive.
	- no emphasis on climate change -> indicative in a failure of long term planning -> myopic.
	- dig at trump? -> individual 
		- might be a little shaky.
	- climate change is a big environmental -> climate fluc. and nat. disaster.

	- all considerations have been satisfied -> civilisation is bound to collapse by BTC.
